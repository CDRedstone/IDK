		<h2>&nbsp;FAQ's</h2>
		<div class="HomeContainer">
		  
			<h4>1. Are these items pre-used?</h4>
			<p> 	Yes, here at IDK we believe in re-using items. All items offered are pre-owned and have been previously used in a professional business environment. Each item has been inspected for functionality and overall condition to ensure it meets our quality standards. While signs of wear such as minor cosmetic imperfections may be present, all equipment is sold in working condition unless otherwise noted. We provide detailed descriptions, specifications, and photographs to offer full transparency. Items may not include original packaging or accessories unless specified. No manufacturer warranties are guaranteed, but we are happy to provide additional information or arrange inspections upon request. All sales are final unless otherwise agreed.</p> 
			
		  <h4>2. Can you return unwanted items?</h4>
			<p> 	Please note that all sales are final, and we do not accept returns or exchanges on any items. As these products are pre-owned and sold as-is, we encourage all buyers to review item descriptions, photos, and specifications carefully before purchasing. We are committed to transparency and are happy to provide additional details or answer any questions prior to sale. By completing a purchase, the buyer acknowledges and agrees to this no-return policy. See terms and contions for more information about returning items.</p>
			
			<h4>3. Why do we need your social security number?</h4>
			<p> 	In some cases, we may require your Social Security Number (SSN) to verify your identity, perform credit checks, or comply with legal and financial regulations. This is especially necessary when processing financing applications, tax-related documentation, or government-required reporting. Your SSN helps us ensure the accuracy of your records and protect against identity fraud. We handle all personal information, including SSNs, with the highest standards of security and confidentiality, in compliance with applicable privacy laws and data protection practices. We want to make sure that you are not expericning too little, or more than enough satisfaction. </p>

		  <p>	 Our business was established to meet the growing need for [products/services your business offers] with a focus on quality, reliability, and customer service. We are committed to providing value through practical solutions that help our customers succeed, whether by improving efficiency, offering cost-effective alternatives, or delivering expert support.

		  <h4>5. How do we now know everything about you?</h4>
		<p>		While we strive to provide personalized service, please understand that we may not have complete information about every customer. We only collect the details necessary to fulfill orders, provide support, or meet legal and operational requirements. Unless you choose to share certain information with us—such as specific preferences, updates, or personal circumstances—we may not be aware of them.
