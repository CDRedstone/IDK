		<h2>Careers</h2>
		<div class="HomeContainer">
		  <p> Here at IDK, we have many career and job options, both part-time and fulltime! Some of these are a little bit more... unique than the jobs you'd be able to find at other places! Although we have many, many options, we do also have a somewhat strict criteria when it comes to choosing our hires. We expect all of our hires to be young, and in shape! People in the middle ages cannot be hired, but we do take a little bit of pity when it comes to a specific group of our hires. The elderly! If you're elderlty, perhaps already retired and looking for a way to get money, you can work for us! We will also supply a place for you to stay if you so desire. These shelters, or mini homes, will also have food shipped to them everyday and have anything you'd need provided so that you can keep working.</p>
			<h4>1. Transportation/Shipping</h4>
			<li><strong>Delivery Person</strong>:We will always be hiring delivery people! With this job, you can also choose wether you want to live with us, or stay at home! If you choose to live with us, you will be provided with a bike (no training wheels). If you're living on your lonesome, you can use whatever vehicle you'd like to deliver packages!</li>
			<li><strong>Transportation Manager</strong>: As a transportation manager, you have authority over any other people within the Transportation/Shipping section! You do not have authority over any others, but isn't that so fun, anyways? EIther way, your job as a transportation manager is fairly easy! You will spend your days double-checking and deciding where to ship packages to, and which need to be delivered by foot and which need to be shipped. You get to make all these decisions, regardless of how far away a place may be!</li>
		
		 
		  <h4>2. How We Use Your Data</h4>
			<li><strong>To Make Slightly Better Products</strong>: Your data helps us make our items “decently” better (haha, get it?). But mostly, we just enjoy knowing that you like our products.</li>
			<li><strong>For Unsolicited Email Campaigns</strong>: We will send you emails asking about your day, your favorite color, and if you prefer your socks inside-out or right-side up. If you reply, we’ll start sending double the ammount of emails as before!</li>
			<li> <strong> To Track Your Shopping Decisions</strong>: We want to know why you bought three of the same thing. Were you feeling nostalgic? Or just collecting them for a future art project? We’ll never know, but we’ll try to guess.</li>
			<li><strong>For Surprisingly Accurate Psychic Predictions</strong>: Occasionally, we use your browsing history to predict what you’ll need in the future. In fact, we already know you’ll be back for that weird kitchen gadget in two weeks. We’ll send you an email reminding you when it’s time.</li>
			
		  <h4>3. Sharing Your Data (who we share your data with!)</h4>
		  <li> <strong> Our Incompetent AI</strong>: We have an AI that tries really hard to understand your preferences. It’s still learning, so sometimes it will just give you a random product recommendation, like a cactus-shaped mug. It puts these reccomended items straight into your cart!</li>
			<li><strong>The Governmen</strong>t: Just kidding. We’re pretty sure the government doesn’t care about what you order from IDK. However, if you send us an email about your favorite conspiracy theory, we’ll probably share it with them, just to keep things spicy.</li>
				
		  <h4>4. Your Rights, You have the following rights (and some additional privileges you didn’t ask for):</h4>
				<li><strong>The Right to Disappear</strong>: If you ever want us to forget you, simply stop buying our products and vanish into the digital ether. We will reluctantly comply, but expect a final “We Miss You” email… every week!</li>
			    <li><strong>The Right to Absolutely No Consequences</strong>: If you make a questionable decision, like ordering 10 of the same item, you will not face any consequences, aside from endless regret.</li>
          
		  <h4>5. Data Storage</h4>
			<li>Your data is stored in a digital vault that we’ve hidden somewhere on the internet. It’s guarded by several rogue cookies and a handful of confused servers. Every time we update our privacy policy, we scatter some data across various corners of the web, just in case you’re curious about what happens to it. </li>
			
		  <h4>6. Cookies</h4>
		  <li>We use cookies. Not the edible kind (sorry), but the digital kind. These cookies help us remember if you prefer your items shipped in a box that’s slightly too large or in a bag that’s completely insufficient. Cookies also help us track your movements on our website and determine if you’re the type to linger too long on the “almost out of stock” items, making us feel bad about our product availability. 
</li>
			
		  <h4>7. Changes to this Policy</h4>
			<li>We may change this policy at any time, but only when we remember to. If we update it, we’ll send you a paper letter via pigeon or leave a note on your door. Just kidding, we’ll email you... eventually.</li>
