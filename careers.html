		<h2>Join Us!</h2>
		<div class="HomeContainer">
		  <p> Here at IDK, we have many career and job options, both part-time and fulltime! Some of these are a little bit more... unique than the jobs you'd be able to find at other places! Although we have many, many options, we do also have a somewhat strict criteria when it comes to choosing our hires. We expect all of our hires to be young, and in shape! People in the middle ages cannot be hired, but we do take a little bit of pity when it comes to a specific group of our hires. The elderly! If you're elderlty, perhaps already retired and looking for a way to get money, you can work for us! We will also supply a place for you to stay if you so desire. These shelters, or... mini homes, will also have food shipped to them everyday and have anything you'd need provided so that you can keep working. To apply, send an application and we will reach out to you sometime in between now, and in a couple years.</p>
			<h4>Transportation/Shipping</h4>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Delivery Person</strong>: We will always be hiring delivery people! With this job, you can also choose wether you want to live with us, or stay at home! If you choose to live with us, you will be provided with a bike (no training wheels). If you're living on your lonesome, you can use whatever vehicle you'd like to deliver packages!</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Transportation Manager</strong>: As a transportation manager, you have authority over any other people within the Transportation/Shipping section! You do not have authority over any others, but isn't that so fun, anyways? EIther way, your job as a transportation manager is fairly easy! You will spend your days double-checking and deciding where to ship packages to, and which need to be delivered by foot and which need to be shipped. You get to make all these decisions, regardless of how far away a place may be!</li>
		  <br>
			
		  <h4>Tech &amp; Engineering<strong style="color: #446B6E"><strong style="color: #446B6E"></strong></strong></h4>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Security/Website Manager</strong>: Website managers and moderators are people that are very crucial for the company! As a Web Manager, you will be in charge of making sure that the website stays up and running (not including any legal issues).</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Product Manager</strong>: No, this job does not make it so that you're able to choose the products that we sell. Rather, you can give out ideas but mainly, you spend your time looking over our (digital) stocks, to see what we still have or if we need to remove one of our products.</li>
			<li> <strong style="color: #446B6E">Data Analyst</strong>: As a data analyst, you go over all of the data that we are given on products, and manage all of the statistics that we need to know if we are still able to afford something! You're also in charge of the statistics of our own company.</li>
			<li> <strong style="color: #446B6E">Customer/Tech Support</strong>: Fairly self explanitory, don't you think? You're in charage of taking calls and responding to questions.</li>
			<li> <strong style="color: #446B6E">Builder</strong>: In the very, very rare case that we have something that needs to be hand-built, you're responsible for that! IF you dont have anything to do, don't worry, you will still be packaging all of the boxes.</li>
		
			<br>
			
		  <h4>ALL ROUNDERS</h4>
		  <li>Self explanitory, doesn't really need much more of an explaination. You're in charge of doing whatever you get assigned to do that day, think of it as daily chores. You're most likely to get hired for this position.</li>
