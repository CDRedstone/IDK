		<h2>&nbsp;IDK's Privacy Policy</h2>
		<div class="HomeContainer">
		  <p> At IDK (Items Decently Kreated), we take your privacy as seriously as we take our commitment to making products!  While we might not know exactly what we’re doing most of the time, we definitely know how to collect and protect your personal information… sort of. Please read this Privacy Policy, as it’s filled with a lot of important imformation.</p>
		  
			<h4>1. What We Collect,</h4>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Basic Information</strong>: Your name, email, birthday (so we can send you a totally unnecessary birthday card), and shoe size. Why? No reason, really, we just like knowing these things. We also, of course, know your credit card number (once you give it to us)! However, unlike other websites, you cant remove your card from our database. Be keep it stored, just incase you decide to leave and come back, so you wont have to go through the pricess of adding it back. Thank us, please!</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Data From Your Favorite Snacks</strong>: If you eat our products (which we hope you do), we collect data about your favorite flavors, textures, and how often you cry when something is too spicy. This helps us “improve” our items (but mostly we just like the data).</li>
		  <li> <strong style="color: #446B6E"> Metadata From Your Unexplained Search History</strong>: Every time you search for something like “how to use IDK products” or “why did I order 7 pairs of socks?”, we’ll be there collecting the data. Don’t worry, we won’t judge (we totally will)</li>
		  <li><strong style="color: #446B6E">Footprints in the Sand</strong>: We may or may not be tracking your footsteps on our website, and other websites! We actually fetch your entire digital footprint... just to make sure we dont have any bad people buying from us.</li>
		 
		  <h4>2. How We Use Your Data</h4>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">To Make Slightly Better Products</strong>: Your data helps us make our items “decently” better (haha, get it?). But mostly, we just enjoy knowing that you like our products.</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">For Unsolicited Email Campaigns</strong>: We will send you emails asking about your day, your favorite color, and if you prefer your socks inside-out or right-side up. If you reply, we’ll start sending double the ammount of emails as before!</li>
			<li> <strong style="color: #446B6E"> To Track Your Shopping Decisions</strong>: We want to know why you bought three of the same thing. Were you feeling nostalgic? Or just collecting them for a future art project? We’ll never know, but we’ll try to guess.</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">For Surprisingly Accurate Psychic Predictions</strong>: Occasionally, we use your browsing history to predict what you’ll need in the future. In fact, we already know you’ll be back for that weird kitchen gadget in two weeks. We’ll send you an email reminding you when it’s time.</li>
			
		  <h4>3. Sharing Your Data (who we share your data with!)</h4>
		  <li> <strong style="color: #446B6E"> Our Incompetent AI</strong>: We have an AI that tries really hard to understand your preferences. It’s still learning, so sometimes it will just give you a random product recommendation, like a cactus-shaped mug. It puts these reccomended items straight into your cart!</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">The Government</strong>: Just kidding. We’re pretty sure the government doesn’t care about what you order from IDK. However, if you send us an email about your favorite conspiracy theory, we’ll probably share it with them, just to keep things spicy.</li>
				
		  <h4>4. Your Rights, (and some additional privileges you didn’t ask for):</h4>
				<li><strong style="color: #446B6E">The Right to Disappear</strong>: If you ever want us to forget you, simply stop buying our products and vanish into the digital ether. We will reluctantly comply, but expect a final “We Miss You” email… every week!</li>
			    <li><strong style="color: #446B6E">The Right to Absolutely No Consequences</strong>: If you make a questionable decision, like ordering 10 of the same item, you will not face any consequences, aside from endless regret.</li>
          
		  <h4>5. Data Storage</h4>
			<li>Your data is stored in a digital vault that we’ve hidden somewhere on the internet. It’s guarded by several rogue cookies and a handful of confused servers. Every time we update our privacy policy, we scatter some data across various corners of the web, just in case you’re curious about what happens to it. </li>
			
		  <h4>6. Cookies</h4>
		  <li>We use cookies. Not the edible kind (sorry), but the digital kind. These cookies help us remember if you prefer your items shipped in a box that’s slightly too large or in a bag that’s completely insufficient. Cookies also help us track your movements on our website and determine if you’re the type to linger too long on the “almost out of stock” items, making us feel bad about our product availability. 
</li>
			
		  <h4>7. Changes to this Policy</h4>
			<li>We may change this policy at any time, but only when we remember to. If we update it, we’ll send you a paper letter via pigeon or leave a note on your door. Just kidding, we’ll email you... eventually.</li>
